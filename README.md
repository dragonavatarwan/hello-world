# hello-world
My Name is Adit Mukherjee and I am currently studying at Purdue University with a major in Computer Information Technology.
I have been interested in technology for as long as I can remember and studying it in school seemed like the natural continuation of my interests.
I also am pursuing a minor in Political Science because I want to understand how the world works, something that I have been following for quite some time now.
